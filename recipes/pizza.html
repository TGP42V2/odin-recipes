        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A simple recipe for a basic pepperoni pizza. What isn't there to love?</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>12 oz. tomato paste</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano, crushed</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried basil, crushed</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups and 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
            <li>¼ oz. yeast</li>
            <li>½ tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>⅔ cup very warm water (120 degrees F to 130 degrees F) </li>
            <li>2 ½ tablespoons and ½ teaspoon oil</li>
            <li> 6 oz pepperoni</li>
            <li>½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese, or more to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>For sauce: Combine all sauce ingredients with 1/2 cup water in a medium bowl; set aside for flavors to develop while making crust. Freeze remaining paste .</li>
            <li>For crusts: Combine 2 cups of flour with the dry yeast, sugar and salt. Add the water and oil and mix until well blended (about 1 minute). Gradually add enough remaining flour slowly, until a soft, sticky dough ball is formed.</li>
            <li>Knead for about 4 minutes, on a floured surface, until dough is smooth and elastic. Add more flour, if needed. (If using RapidRise® Yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)</li>
            <li>Pat dough (with floured hands) into a 12-inch greased pizza pan OR roll dough to fit pans.</li>
            <li>For pizzas: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Top crusts with sauce, pepperoni and cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake for 18 to 20 minutes until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly. </li>
        </ol>
